## Notes
- If a parent has set an alarm, the child is not notified if the alarm
 is raised. So, we will need to terminate the child. 
- We can't pass data to a signal handler. So, we have to rely on globals.
 Note that in some cases, we do not block signals while setting the globals.
 This is a generally bad practice.
##Todo:
- Implement subset sum.
